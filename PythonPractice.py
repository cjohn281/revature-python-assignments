# 3. Make a multiplication table using a loop

# 4. Output the numbers 1 to 10 backwards using a loop

###### While loops #####

# 1. Make a program that lists the countries in the set below using a while loop. clist = ["Canada","USA","Mexico"]

# 2. What‟s the difference between a while loop and a for loop?

# 3. Can you sum numbers in a while loop?

# 4. Can a for loop be used inside a while loop?


##### Functions #####

# 4. Can variables defined in a function be used in another function? (hint: scope)


##### Lists #####

# Make a program that displays the states in the U.S. states = [ 'Alabama', .. ,'Wyoming' ]

# Display all states starting with the letter M


##### List operations #####

# Given the list y = [6,4,2] add the items 12, 8 and 4.

# Change the 2nd item of the list to 3.


##### Sorting list #####

# Given a list with pairs, sort on the first element
#     x = [ (3,6),(4,7),(5,9),(8,4),(3,1)]

# Now sort on the second element


##### Range function #####

# Create a list of one thousand numbers

# Get the largest and smallest number from that list

# Create two lists, an even and odd one.


##### Dictionary #####

# Make a mapping from countries to country short codes

# Print each item (key and value)


##### Read file #####

# Read a file and number every line

# Find out what the program does if the file doesn‟t exist.

# What happens if you create a file with another user and try to open it?

# Create a program where every person meets the other
#     persons = [ “John”, “Marissa”, “Pete”, “Dayton” ]

# If a normal for loop finishes in n steps O(n), how many steps has a nested loop?
